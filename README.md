# Distributed-file-system-using-GRPC-and-Python-wiith-Quorum-protocol

Abstract:
In today’s digital landscape, distributed file systems (DFS) are crucial for managing large-scale data across multiple servers. While established systems like HDFS and Ceph offer robust solutions for file storage and retrieval, they often encounter challenges such as scalability, fault tolerance, and workload efficiency. This paper introduces a novel distributed file system designed to address these limitations through a more flexible, reliable, and scalable architecture.

Our proposed system comprises three main components: SuperNode, responsible for coordinating file operations and maintaining metadata; DataNodes, where files are stored; and Clients, which interact with the system for file operations. A quorum protocol is implemented to ensure data consistency and fault tolerance, routing read and write requests dynamically based on load and availability. The system supports varying workloads, including read-heavy, write-heavy, and balanced operations, while providing real-time monitoring of the file system state.

Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the system's performance across speed, scalability, and fault tolerance metrics. The results demonstrate that our system efficiently handles a high volume of operations and recovers seamlessly from node failures. This innovative approach offers a robust foundation for scalable and maintainable distributed systems, making it well-suited for real-world applications.

1. Introduction
In the era of big data, distributed file systems play a pivotal role in managing and storing vast amounts of data across interconnected machines. Systems like the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Ceph were developed to meet demands for scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient data retrieval. However, these systems often face limitations such as suboptimal performance under varying workloads, consistency challenges across nodes, and slow recovery from failures.

Key challenges in traditional DFS architectures include:

Balancing read and write operations: Many systems treat these operations equally, leading to bottlenecks when one type dominates.
Efficient fault tolerance mechanisms: While replication and recovery exist, their implementation can compromise performance.
Monitoring system health at scale: Managing system state and performance becomes increasingly complex as scale increases.
To address these issues, we propose a distributed file system that integrates a quorum protocol to enhance consistency, fault tolerance, and workload balancing. The system dynamically manages varying workloads, intelligently routes requests, and allows real-time querying of its state.

2. Objectives and Contributions
Our project introduces several key innovations and contributions:

Scalable and flexible architecture:
The system is designed to handle diverse workloads and scale seamlessly with an increasing number of clients and nodes.
Quorum protocol for consistency and fault tolerance:
The protocol ensures reliable operations even during node failures or network partitions.
Real-time monitoring:
Clients can query the system’s state, offering improved transparency and manageability.
Comprehensive performance evaluation:
We assess the system’s throughput, latency, and fault tolerance, demonstrating its advantages over existing systems.

3. System Architecture
The proposed file system consists of three main components:

SuperNode:
Manages metadata, coordinates file operations, and ensures smooth communication between nodes.
DataNodes:
Store the actual files and handle read/write operations based on requests.
Clients:
Serve as the interface for users to interact with the system for file operations.

4. Experimental Results
Through rigorous testing, our system showcases significant improvements in:

Throughput: Efficiently handling large-scale operations.
Fault tolerance: Seamless recovery from node failures.
Latency: Reduced response times under varying workloads.
Conclusion:
This distributed file system provides a scalable, reliable, and efficient solution for managing large-scale data. By addressing key limitations in existing systems and introducing innovations like quorum-based consistency and real-time monitoring, our approach lays the groundwork for robust and future-ready distributed systems.
